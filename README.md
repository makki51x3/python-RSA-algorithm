# python-RSA-algorithm
This project includes an implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm. The RSA algorithm is an asymmetric algorithm, meaning it requires two keys in order to function instead of one. The keys in this algorithm are called the public key and the private key, and they are acquired through calculations that include prime numbers. The public key is, as its name suggests, given to the public, whilst the private one should only be known by its owner alone. This being an asymmetric algorithm means that even if third parties will have access to the public key, they would not be able to decrypt the message to the missing private key, making this type of encryption methods highly effective and efficient. Furthermore, the calculations needed to produce the public and private keys, and then encrypt the message are very fast and easy to compute when in possession of both keys, on the other hand the size of said numbers makes splitting the keys and finding the base numbers used to make them extremely difficult.
